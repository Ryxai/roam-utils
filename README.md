# roam-utils
Hosting for some roam utility scripts

[Modded Smartblocks](https://ryxai.github.io/roam-utils/modded_smartblocks.js): A modified version of David Vargas + TFTHacker's Smartblocks app, right now includes one additional command. This is for test purposes only it breaks the store. 

[Smb-ext](https://ryxai.github.io/roam-utils/smb-ext.js): An extension script for smartblocks, lacks the ability to use smartblock variables derived from the build of [this repository](https://github.com/Ryxai/roamjs-sm-ext)

[ext_min](https://ryxai.github.io/roam-utils/ext_min.js): A minimal variation of the extensions in smb-ext, needs to be loaded last to prevent race conditions
